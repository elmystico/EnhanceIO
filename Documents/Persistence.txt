How to create persistent cache
==============================

EnhanceIO caches are persistent by default. A udev rule file named
94-enhanceio-<cache_name>.rules is created, removed by create, delete
sub-commands in eio_cli.

Note
------
1) Creating a writeback cache on root device is not supported. This is because
   the root device is mounted as read only prior to the processing of udev
   rules.
   20180327 my explanation:
   it seems that at reboot disk content is not strictly updated and one needs 
   to enable cache+disk before taking files from boot partition.
   
2) For certain devices such as loop device the udev rule file will not be
   generated 
   20180327: it seems this is not true

3) If you use root filesystem or swap with enhanceio put
   initramfs-tools hook script 'enhanceio.initramfs'
   into /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/ (in Debian distro).
   (!)For the script to work you need pyInstaller: #pip install pyinstaller
   Remember to regenerate initrd (in debian: #update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`).
   The script compiles eio_cli and copies into initrd, so udev can start caches before any mounts.
   Root (boot) partition on writeback cache is not working!!!
